# Greedy-Algorithm-job-scheduling-
Given n jobs defined by (JobID, start time, end time) and two machines (M1, M2), schedule jobs to maximize the total number of non-overlapping jobs across both machines. Each machine can run one job at a time. Design a greedy algorithm and implement it in Python 3.x.
